# PHP code formatter for Sublime Text editor with phptidy
#### [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

## About
This is a Sublime Text 2 plugin allowing you to format your PHP code. This script was created by welovewordpress (https://github.com/welovewordpress/SublimePhpTidy).

In my version, it uses the Allman Style (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style#Allman_style) for PHP-code formatting.

It is based on the [phptidy](http://phptidy.berlios.de/) script by Magnus Rosenbaum.

Modifications were made by Eoin Gallagher and described here:

## Usage
ctrl + shift + P and type `Tidy PHP`, or you can use the ctrl + alt + T keybinding.

## Customize
Custom settings file (for choosing between original phptidy and wp-phptidy) coming soon.

## Install
Just download it and copy the uncompressed folder to your Packages directory of Sublime Text 2.
